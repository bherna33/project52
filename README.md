# Project 52 – A Year of Weekly Coding Projects

Welcome to **Project 52**, a year long challenge where I build **one new project every week for 52 weeks**.  
The goal is simple: **rediscover creativity, build consistently, and have fun coding**.

This repository contains all project files, weekly write-ups, source code, and documentation for the entire challenge.

## 🎯 What Is Project 52?

Every week, I select a **random coding topic** and build a complete project from start to finish.  
No skipping weeks. No perfection. Just consistent creation.

Each project can be:
- A web app  
- A CLI tool  
- A mobile app  
- A game  
- A utility  
- A creative experiment  
- Anything that pushes me to learn something new

## 🧭 Weekly Workflow

**Every week follows the same structure:**

1. **Pick a random coding topic**  
   (Using a wheel, random generator, or curated list.)

2. **Brainstorm ideas**  
   Turn the topic into a unique, fun project concept.

3. **Build the project**  
   Design → code → test → polish (as much as time allows).

4. **Document everything**  
   - Write a README for that week’s folder  
   - Add screenshots / demos  
   - Summarize challenges & lessons learned  

5. **Publish**  
   - Commit project files  
   - Share progress online  
   - Clip highlights for Shorts

## 📜 Rules & Constraints

To keep the challenge honest and focused, here are the constraints:

### 1. One project per week — no exceptions.
If life gets busy, I simplify the idea but still deliver something.

### 2. Each project must be completed in the same week it’s started.
No stacking work ahead of time.

### 3. The topic must be random.
This avoids comfort-zone projects and keeps things interesting.

### 4. Projects must be functional.
Not perfect — but they must run and do something meaningful.

### 5. Everything must be documented.
A clear README, screenshots, notes, and reflection.

### 6. Have fun.
The main goal is to reignite my love for coding and creativity.

Each week lives in its own folder with:
- Code  
- Notes  
- Images/videos  
- Final summary

## 🎬 Project 52 Series

I’m also turning this challenge into a weekly video series where I show:  
- The topic selection  
- The build  
- The struggles (because there will be many)  
- The final product

## 💡 Why I’m Doing This

Coding used to feel fun and creative — but somewhere along the way, pressure, AI noise, and burnout made it feel like a job again.  
This challenge is about reclaiming the excitement of building things just because they’re cool.
